# Zomato Success Prediction
## Overview
The primary objective of this project was to unravel the factors driving the success of restaurants in the city of Bangalore, India using data from Zomato. My endeavour focused on two main goals: firstly, to identify the crucial elements influencing a restaurant's popularity and customer satisfaction on Zomato; and secondly, to develop a predictive model capable of estimating the potential success of new restaurants on the platform. This exploration aimed to provide valuable insights for restaurant owners and Zomato, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning in the competitive culinary landscape of Bangalore.
